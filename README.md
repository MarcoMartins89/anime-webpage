This project is a Single Page Application (SPA) built using jQuery and vanilla JavaScript. It aims to provide users with an interactive web page where they can navigate discovering a world of anime and manga information. The users can scroll up and down, while reading the information on the page, and also have a previous and next button to change the view adding more information. In one of the pages there is also a filter, to sort by genre and by type, to make it easy, for the user to find what best suits its needs, and make the navigation more user friendly.
